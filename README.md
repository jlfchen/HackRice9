Run project as a flask website

User uploads a potential Tinder photo to the website, then can view their "Pimp Score" to rate the attractiveness of their face with a convolutional neural network developed on a training data set with attractiveness ratings.  Users can then view similar Tinder profile pictures to theirs based clusters from a K-Means algorithm.

Project must also include PCA pickle files, which can be found hosted here:
